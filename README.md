## About

I made a tinder-inspired app for people to meet and socialize at the exclusive Jackson Tree Music and Arts Festival, hence, the name: Jackson Treender. ;)

This video was created to demo my final project and my comprehensive knowledge of web development after a 15 week bootcamp at Flatiron School. For this app, I used React Native for my front end, Redux as my state management tool (both for the first time as of this project!) and Rails on Ruby for my backend.

This app is still a work in progress and still needs a lot of code-clean up but I am proud of of the results and of how much I've learned in the last 15 weeks!
